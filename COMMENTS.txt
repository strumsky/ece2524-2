Assignment 5


1. You can have a different function take in the values of a specific map. This way there values could be outputed to other functions
for part of the game. For example to determine how much natural resources or how to find the hidden treasure.

2. Second, you can reduce the amount of code by just setting limits based on the maps limits and set if statements to ensure a person doesn't
go off the map.

3. Maybe, later on you can add different maps together with a different function.

Overall, it's a good code just need to break down functionally so can optimize capabilities of the whole game. Based on the 
Rules of Unix(specifically modularity).
